2. **Environment Configuration**

   Ensure your `.env` file contains the following Supabase configuration:

   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

3. **Start the Application**

   Start the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The admin dashboard will be available at:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173/admin
